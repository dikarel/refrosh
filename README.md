# refrosh

Simple auto-reload for JS projects

## Goals

- Easy to search
- Easy to install
- Easy to use
- KISS design

## Install

```
npm install -g refrosh
```

## How to use

```
refrosh <path to your JS file>
```

This will start a local web server and open up the browser. Any changes to the JS file will cause the page to be reloaded

## Potential avenues for improvement

- Transpilation (e.g. TypeScript, ES7, React)
- CLI parameters (e.g. port number, debounce delay)
- External libraries (e.g. React, Lodash)
- Publish (e.g. JSFiddle, Heroku)

Will look into the above if there's interest/traction.
